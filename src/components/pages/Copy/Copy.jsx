                            Copyright is the legal right creators are entitled to for their literary, dramatics, music, and artistic work. Producers of films and recordings enjoy this right too. When a proprietor registers for a copyright, it gives them an exclusive right to reproduce, replicate, and distribute the work. Further, they can grant authority to some other entity for the same purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>Registering for copyright is important because it makes you the legal owner of the rights </p>

                                How Copyrighting Works
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                A copyright protects the expression of an idea. Unlike a patent, which protects the idea itself, copyright protects only the expression.
                            </p>
                            <p>As the owner of the copyright, the author has the unique right to produce copies of the work, to exhibit and perform it publicly, and to distribute copies of the work to the public. These exclusive rights are valid for the author's lifetime plus 70 years. A work made for hire, on the other hand, has a copyright that lasts for a fixed period of 95 years from the date of creation.</p>
                            <p>The work must be original to the creator in order to be protected by copyright. To be unique, the work should:</p>

                                <li className="arrow">Note: The work will be terminated and will not be entitled to copyright protection if these two conditions are not met.</li>

                            <p>
                                The Copyright Act 1957 (the Act), supported by the Copyright Rules 1958 (the Rules), is the governing law for copyright protection in India. Substantial amendments carries out to the Copyright Act in 2012. India follows a common law legal system, so relies on case law to interpret and set precedents in law and so the judicial decisions contribute to the sources of copyright law in India. India is a member of the Berne Conventions and Universal Copyright Convention. The Government of India has also passed the International Copyright Order, 1999. According to this Order, any work first published in any country that is a member of any of the above conventions is granted the same treatment as if it was first published in India.
                            </p>
                            <p>The copyright law aims to balance the interests of those who create content, with the public interest in having the widest possible access to that content. WIPO administers several international treaties in the area of copyright and related rights.</p>

                                What Can Be Protected By Copyright?
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Copyright, a form of intellectual property law, protects original works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software, and architecture. Copyright does not protect facts, ideas, systems, or methods of operation, although it may protect the way these things are expressed.

                                Nine categories of works are copyrightable:

                            <ul>
                                <li className="arrow">Books - Copyright protection provides legal protection to the author's works in the case of literary works. Since everything is altered, transferred, and copied so quickly in our era, the copyright registration for literary work is more commonly used for book publishing and newsletters.</li>
                                <li className="arrow">Software - The IT sector in India is quickly expanding, necessitating the protection of your unique work or software. Many programmers, coders, and developers get cheated when they come across software that is close to or identical to what they created. The copyright registration for software prevents any individual or third-party company from gaining unofficial access to the software.</li>
                                <li className="arrow">Scripts - A script is a written outline for a play, television programme, or film. Copyrighting a creative workâ€”such as a scriptâ€”prevents individuals from engaging in unauthorised use of your script, such as intentional and accidental copying, publishing, transmitting, exhibiting, distributing, modifying, and displaying other people's original creative expressions.</li>
                                <li className="arrow">Lyrics - When you register a copyright, you have full copyright protection for your song. Copyright protects your lyrics as soon as you write them, even if it's only on a bit of paper. The copyright registration of lyrics gives the song constructive notice. The melody, lyrics, percussion track on the recording and chord progression in the bridge are all distinct and expressive elements to which the author might claim any of the exclusive rights.</li>
                                <li className="arrow">Websites - Text, tables, computer programmes, compilations, including computer databases; photographs, paintings, diagrams, maps, charts, and plans; and works incorporating music, including graphical notation of such work that may be copyrightable are among the digital assets on the website. You only have copyright rights to the elements of a website that you created as an author.</li>
                                <li className="arrow">Apps - Copyrights can be used to safeguard intellectual property such as computer programs. Early designs of creativity can take on many forms, including software code, graphics, and models used to create mobile applications and other computer software. Copyright registration of software allows a developer to more easily defend his work if it is attempted to be copied. For software copyrights, the code, as well as copies of artwork and audiovisual content, must be included with the application.</li>
                                <li className="arrow">Videos - Copyright registration for video serves as a clear evidence in any copyright infringement lawsuit you may file, and it makes collecting damages much easier in such a situation. It's a simple way to establish your video rights. If you actually want to protect your work, copyrighting your videos should be at the top of your priority list.</li>
                                <li className="arrow">Songs - It is important to obtain copyright protection for your song, as it is now easier than ever for others to use your work without giving you the credit you deserve. If you're a new musician, it's even more crucial to think about copyright protection because you might not have the resources to fight if your song is misused/pirated.</li>
                                <li className="arrow">Music - Whether you're attempting to safeguard a song or a symphony, the first step is to get the music down in some tangible format, such as recording or writing on music staff paper. It can be difficult to assert your rights in a copyright infringement claim if you do not have recognised copyright for your music. And as a musician with registered copyright for your work, you have a lot of exclusive rights.</li>

                        </h2>
                        <p>The Copyright Act of 1957 prevents the unauthorized use of any original literary, musical, dramatic, audio, cinematographic, and other artistic work. Both published and unpublished works can be copyrighted, and the original workâ€™s copyright is reserved for the original creator. Copyright can also be registered for works that were published before 21 January 1958, that is before the Copyright Act came into existence.</p>
                        <p>Copyright protection of original literary, musical, dramatic, and artistic works lasts for the entire lifetime of the author and another 60 years from the year following the death of the author. For cinematograph films, sound recordings, photographs, posthumous publications, anonymous and pseudonymous publications, works of government, and works of international organizations, the 60 years is counted from the date of publication.</p>

                                    Privacy is the state of being private; the state of not being seen by others, whereas copyright is (uncountable) the legal right to be the entity that determines who may publish, copy, and distribute a piece of writing, music, picture, or other work of authorship. The right to have some control over how your personal information is gathered and utilised is known as information privacy.
