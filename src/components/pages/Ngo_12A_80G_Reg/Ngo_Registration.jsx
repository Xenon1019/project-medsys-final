                            NGOs primarily rely on donations to support their functioning. To claim those tax exemptions (available to both donors and recipients), NGOs are to register under Section 80G and Section 12A of the Income Tax Act. The process is complicated and time-consuming, and it can be difficult for non-professionals to do it.
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover, recent changes have mandated that all the NGOs who have already registered under these 2 sections re-register under sections 80G and 12A to continue enjoying those tax benefits. Further, if an NGO seeks CSR funding, they are required to register using Form CSR-1.</p>

                                        We can apply for 12A and 80G soon after the Trust is registered. If in case the customer is applying after a year or two then their ITR is required.

                                        Yes, you can apply for them separately in which case you have to apply for 12A first. However, doing them together is easier.

                                        Earlier, 80G and 12A registrations were valid for the lifetime of an organisation. Now, in the case of provisional registration, the validity of 80G and 12A registrations has been kept at 3 years, or for 3 years from the commencement of activities, whichever is earlier and, in case of re-validation, the validity is 5 years.
